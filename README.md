# College Professor Salary Analysis using R

This is my final project from STAT383: Probability and Statistics at Clarkson University. We were tasked with writing a paper on a dataset and doing some
statistical anaylisis on the data. I chose to examine college professors salary and how experience effects a professors salary. This will be decided by 
using data accross multiple statistics such as degree, years at degree, rank, and years at rank. The question of whether or not there is a discrimination
between women and male salaries for college professors will also be answered. The data was retreived from data.princeton.edu, this a website that contains 
many popular data sets. This data was collected by S. Weisberg for his book Applied Linear Regression in 1985 and contains the information of 52 
tenure-track professors at a small college.

## Usage
To read the paper simply open up PaytonShafer.nb.html in your web browser of choice. The html file is compiled from the rmd file, PaytonShafer.rmd, which contains all the source code for the paper. To see all of the code I used within the project look in project.r, this contains the code used to anaylize the data on professors salary. To run that code, open it in Rstudio and run the blocks you would like to see.
